# E-commerce Console Application

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Overview

This is a console-based e-commerce application built to simulate an online store. It allows users to browse products, add items to a cart, manage their cart, and perform checkout operations. The application is designed as a challenge to demonstrate core programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, data management, and user interaction in a console environment.

## Features

- **Product Catalog**: View a list of available products with details like name, price, and description.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, or update items in the cart.
- **Checkout Process**: Calculate total cost and simulate a purchase.
- **User Management**: Register and log in as a customer (optional admin panel for managing products).
- **Console Interface**: Simple text-based interface for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: [Specify the programming language, e.g., Java, Python, C++, etc.]
